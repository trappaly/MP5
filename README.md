Short Description: AAC.java uses the files AACCateogry, AAACMappings, and AssociativeArray.java. In AAC.java, the file adds the 
AAACMappingsNew.txt file. It has categories of food and clothing. If you click on the category, there will be different types of food in
the food category and different types of clothing in the clothing category. When you click on an item, within the category it will speak
out the word associated with the category. 

Instructions for Running the Program: Press the play button in VSC code. After you press the play button, the program will go to a home screen
with the categories. To add a new item to a category, you press the add button and enter in the image location 
and the word that you want the image to say.
